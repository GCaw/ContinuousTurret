# ContinuousTurret
Source code from project I worked on in university

More info available here: http://blog.gcawood.com/2011/10/21/camera-turret/

The PythonGUI.py file is the source code for the GUI intereface for my device. Worked for Python 2.7, serial package was not compatible with Python 3.

The Arduino.pde file is the source code for the controller. It communicated via serial with the GUI, and with the motor controllers and it read data from the hall effect sensors.
